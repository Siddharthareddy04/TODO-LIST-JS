A TODO-LIST Application using JavaScript. Using JavaScript, we can store the tasks in the TODO-LIST in the Local Storage.
Even if we refresh the page, it will show all the previous tasks in the TODO-LIST until we permenantly delete from the Local Storage.
Here I used the JSON format to add the new tasks into the TODO-LIST where I assigned a unique number for every new task and the unique number will be updated when we delete the existing tasks in the TODO-LIST.
I used HTML, CSS and BOOTSTRAP for desiging in a dynamic way.
